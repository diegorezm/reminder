# Reminder

## Description

So i can remember stuff while i'm on the terminal.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diegorezm/reminder.git && make install
```


## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress. I'm not actually following any best practices or anything. 
Sometimes you will see me using the 'usecases' package, sometimes you will see me using the 'store' directly.

## Inspiration

Saw this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkNv3KGOFT0 and thought it would be fun to do something similar.
Since i'm a webdev i made it a lot more complex than it needed to be.
